# Rubee Protocol Implementation

This folder contains the implementation of the Rubee protocol on FPGA/ASIC. The Rubee protocol is a communication protocol designed for robust and efficient data transfer in embedded systems. The implementation leverages FPGA/ASIC technology to achieve high performance and reliability.

## Objectives

- Develop a VHDL-based implementation of the Rubee protocol.
- Simulate and verify the design using AMD Vivado Simulator.
- Optimize the design for FPGA/ASIC deployment.
- Ensure compliance with the Rubee protocol specifications.

## Directory Structure

- **Rubee_Protocol.hw/**: Hardware-related files.
- **Rubee_Protocol.ip_user_files/**: User files for IP cores.
- **Rubee_Protocol.sim/**: Simulation files and scripts.
- **Rubee_Protocol.srcs/**: Source files for the Rubee protocol implementation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Rubee_Protocol` directory.
3. Open the project in Vivado using the `Rubee_Protocol.xpr` file.
4. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` files within each directory for specific setup and usage.
